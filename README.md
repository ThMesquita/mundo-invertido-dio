# Mundo Invertido - Front-end Challenge

This project was built as part of a front-end development challenge by DIO (Digital Innovation One). It is a simple website inspired by the series *Stranger Things* that aims to simulate the concept of an "Invertido Mundo" (Upside Down World). 

The website incorporates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts to create an interactive experience where users can explore a fictional world, watch a trailer, and even sign up for a Dungeons & Dragons club.

## Features

- **Light and Dark Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between a light theme and a dark theme using a button that inverts the world on the page.
- **Audio**: The site features background audio that plays automatically when the page is loaded.
- **Interactive Form**: A form for signing up to a fictional Dungeons & Dragons club, where users can enter their name, email, character, and level.
- **Gallery**: A collection of images from the series showcasing some of the main characters and scenes.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations for a dynamic and visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for interactive elements.
